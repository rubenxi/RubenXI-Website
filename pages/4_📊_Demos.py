                            **This project consists of a Python script that, using web scraping, accesses the Liveuamap website to collect the most recent news from the site. To do this, it first gathers all the available country or open conflict options on the website. By combining the links to these pages with certain parameters, it obtains the link to the news page for that specific topic. After that, it collects all the news articles one by one, along with their publication time and description, as well as a link to each article for further information. I created this Python script to learn how to use web scraping and to become more familiar with Python.**
