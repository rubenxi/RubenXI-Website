# RubenXI-Website
 My website, built with Python and Streamlit. 

Check the AI chat to ask about me or see my GitHub repos!. You can also find cool animations and some interesting projects. The web has many themes to try, the default is dark blue.

In the Demos section you can find a feature rich AI chat with HuggingFace and Gemini AI capabilities and a news aggregator.
